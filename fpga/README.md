# VARIOUS GATEWARES

A number of different pico-ice gatewares will be hosted here.

**Mecrisp** Ice J1a** This is the basic 16 bit Mecrisp Ice for lattice ICE40.

**Blinky**: A blinky is useful to reset the FPGA, and make sure that you are downloadinga new program.

Hopefully soon the HanaCPU will show up here.
